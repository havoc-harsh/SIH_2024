## Overview

In today's rapidly evolving financial landscape, the rise of decentralized transactions poses unique challenges for regulatory bodies and law enforcement. CryptTrail addresses these challenges by combining blockchain data analysis with advanced AI techniques to deanonymize and assess the risk of P2P Web3 transactions. The platform enables security officials to quickly identify suspicious activities, thereby preventing the movement of illicit funds.

## Features

- **Deanonymization**: Leverages a pre-trained AI model to deanonymize transactions on P2P Web3 platforms.
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Automatically analyzes transaction patterns and flags potential money laundering activities.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides live updates and notifications for transactions that match suspicious criteria.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers an intuitive dashboard for security officials to monitor and investigate flagged transactions.
- **Enhanced Security & Compliance**: Assists organizations in adhering to anti-money laundering regulations and improves overall transactional security.

## Architecture

CryptTrail is built with a modular architecture consisting of the following key components:

- **Frontend**:  
  - A responsive web interface (built with frameworks like React) that displays transaction data, alerts, and detailed reports.
  
- **Backend**:  
  - A server-side application responsible for fetching transaction data from blockchain networks, processing this data, and interfacing with the AI model.
  
- **AI Engine**:  
  - A pre-trained AI model that evaluates transaction data for suspicious symptoms and patterns.
  
- **Blockchain Integration**:  
  - Connectors that interface directly with various blockchain networks to pull P2P transaction data for analysis.
